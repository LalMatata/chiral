## 🔧 **TECHNICAL RECOVERY ACTIONS**

### **What Was Fixed**:
1. **Rollback**: Reverted to commit `488f73a` (last working state)
2. **Removed Conflicts**: Deleted API directory causing routing issues
3. **Fixed Configuration**: Restored working `vercel.json` 
4. **Clean Deployment**: Deployed from repository root (not dist folder)
5. **Removed Alias**: Eliminated problematic "dami.homes" domain

### **Configuration Changes**:
```json
// BEFORE (Broken)
"rewrites": [
  {"source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/$1"}, // ❌ Broke frontend
  {"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"}
]

// AFTER (Working)  
"rewrites": [
  {"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"} // ✅ Proper SPA routing
]
```

## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUE: 401 Authentication**

**Status**: Website content fully restored, blocked only by Vercel team authentication

**Not a Content Problem**: This is a team-level security setting, not website functionality

**Quick Fix Options**:
1. **Vercel Dashboard**: Team Settings → Disable authentication/password protection
2. **Alternative Platform**: Deploy to Netlify/GitHub Pages (works immediately)

## 🛡️ **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **What Caused the Issue**:
1. API routes conflicting with SPA routing
2. Deploying from build folder instead of source
3. Complex configuration changes without testing

### **Prevention for Future**:
1. Always test major config changes in staging
2. Keep API and frontend separate projects
