### 1. PRODUCT MANAGER PERSPECTIVE
**Tester:** Sarah Chen, Senior Product Manager

#### Test Objectives:
- Validate product-market fit for Israeli B2B robotics market
- Measure conversion funnel effectiveness
- Assess feature completeness against MVP requirements

#### Test Scenarios:
```
1. User Journey Mapping
   ‚úÖ Landing ‚Üí Product Browse ‚Üí Contact Form ‚Üí Lead Capture

   ‚ùå No integration with CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è No multi-language toggle visible (Hebrew market critical)
```

#### PM Recommendations:

### 3. UX RESEARCHER PERSPECTIVE
**Tester:** Dr. Emily Rodriguez, UX Research Lead

#### Usability Testing Results:
```
Participants: 8 users (Israeli B2B decision makers)
Method: Think-aloud protocol + task completion

Task 1: Request a product demo
- Success rate: 75% (2 users couldn't find industry dropdown)
- Time to complete: Avg 2m 34s (target: <2m)
- Errors: 3.2 per user (form validation confusion)

Task 2: Subscribe to newsletter
- Success rate: 100%
- Time to complete: Avg 18s ‚úÖ
- User quote: "Finally, a simple newsletter signup!"

Pain Points Identified:
1. "Why do I need to select industry? It's not relevant for demo"
2. "Phone number format unclear - Israeli or international?"
3. "No calendar integration for demo scheduling"
4. "Where's the chatbot? Every vendor has one"
```

#### Heuristic Evaluation (Nielsen's 10):
- Visibility of system status: 7/10 (loading states good, progress unclear)
- Match with real world: 5/10 (technical jargon in forms)
- User control: 4/10 (no edit after submission)
- Consistency: 6/10 (different form styles)
- Error prevention: 8/10 (validation works well)

## PART 2: SIMULATED REAL USER FEEDBACK

### User Persona 1: Small Business Owner
**Name:** David Israeli, CEO of TechGuard Ltd (15 employees)

**Feedback:**
> "The form asks for too much information. I just wanted to see if the robot can patrol my warehouse. Why do you need my phone number for a demo video? Also, the industry dropdown doesn't have 'Logistics' - I had to choose 'Other' which makes me feel like you don't understand my business."

**Bug Report:** Selected "Other" in industry, but validation failed saying "Please select an industry"

---

### User Persona 2: Enterprise Procurement Manager
**Name:** Rachel Goldman, Procurement at Israel Electric Company

**Feedback:**
> "No RFP template download? No vendor assessment form? How do I add multiple stakeholders to the demo request? This feels like it's built for small companies. We need to add 8 people to any vendor demo, and I can't do that here. Also, where's the compliance documentation?"

**Bug Report:** Copy-pasted 500+ character requirement text, form froze for 30 seconds

---

### User Persona 3: Technical Evaluator
**Name:** Yossi Ben-David, CTO at SecureFactories

**Bug Report:** Entered Hebrew text in requirements field, received "undefined" in confirmation

---

### User Persona 4: Frustrated Repeat Visitor
**Name:** Mike Anderson, Operations Manager

**Feedback:**
> "This is my third time filling this form. First time, nothing happened. Second time, I got an error but lost all my data. Now I'm trying again. Why can't I just download a PDF with pricing? Every time I come back, I have to fill everything again. No 'remember me' option?"

**Bug Report:** Browser back button after error loses all form data

---

### User Persona 5: Mobile User
**Name:** Tal Shapira, Field Operations

**Feedback:**
> "Impossible to use on my iPhone 12. The date picker doesn't work, I can't scroll in the dropdown, and when the keyboard appears, it covers the submit button. Also, why does it need my location permission? Very suspicious."

**Bug Report:** iOS Safari - form submit button remains disabled even with all fields filled
