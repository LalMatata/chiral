# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CHIRAL Robotics Website - A modern React-based bilingual promotional website for CHIRAL, Israel's premier provider of advanced quadruped robotics solutions. The website serves as the primary digital presence for lead generation and brand establishment in the Israeli market.

## Common Development Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (using PNPM)
pnpm install

# Start development server (runs on localhost)
pnpm run dev

# Start full development environment (frontend + backend server)
pnpm run dev:full

# Start backend server only
pnpm run server

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview production build locally
pnpm run preview

# Run linter
pnpm run lint
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Deploy according to your hosting platform
# Deployment commands are kept private for security
```

## High-Level Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with React Router DOM for routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5 for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design system
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/UI component library (located in `src/components/ui/`)
- **Package Manager**: PNPM (required - version specified in package.json)
- **Language Support**: Bilingual (English/Hebrew) with RTL support

### Code Structure

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Entry Points**:
   - `src/main.jsx` - Application entry point
   - `src/App.jsx` - Main component with routing setup

2. **Core Components** (`src/components/`):
   - `Header.jsx` - Navigation and language toggle
   - `Footer.jsx` - Footer with links and contact info
   - `pages/` - Page components for each route:
     - `Home.jsx` - Landing page with hero section
     - `Products.jsx` - Product catalog
     - `ProductDetail.jsx` - Individual product pages (uses route params)
     - `Applications.jsx` - Industry applications showcase
     - `About.jsx` - Company information
     - `Contact.jsx` - Contact forms and information

3. **UI Component Library** (`src/components/ui/`):
   - Pre-built Shadcn/UI components using Radix UI primitives
   - All components follow consistent styling patterns
   - Components are self-contained and reusable

4. **Context Management** (`src/contexts/`):
   - `LanguageContext.jsx` - Manages bilingual content and language switching
   - Provides global language state and translation functions

5. **Styling**:
   - Global styles in `src/index.css` and `src/App.css`
   - Tailwind CSS configuration with custom design tokens
   - Component-level styling using Tailwind utility classes

6. **Assets** (`src/assets/`):
   - Product images organized by category
   - Company and application images
   - All images optimized for web performance

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Bilingual Support**:
   - All content stored in `LanguageContext` with `en` and `he` translations
   - Language switching persists across navigation
   - RTL layout automatically applied for Hebrew

2. **Routing**:
   - React Router DOM v7 for client-side routing
   - Dynamic product pages using route parameters
   - All routes defined in `App.jsx`

3. **Component Architecture**:
   - Functional components with React Hooks
   - Consistent prop passing patterns
   - Error boundaries for robustness

4. **State Management**:
   - Local component state for UI interactions
   - Context API for global language state
   - No external state management library needed

### Performance Considerations

- Code splitting enabled through Vite
- Image lazy loading for optimal performance
- Tailwind CSS purging for minimal CSS bundle
- Component memoization where beneficial

- The website deployment URL is kept private for security
- Full-stack application with Express.js backend for lead management and email handling
- Backend includes SQLite database, email queue system, and admin dashboard
- No environment variables required for basic functionality
- All content translations must be added to both `en` and `he` objects in LanguageContext

### Backend Features
- Lead management system with SQLite database
- Email queue and automated follow-up system
- Admin dashboard for managing leads and email templates
- File upload handling for brochures
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend integration

### Development Security Practices
1. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill with real values
2. **Local Storage**: Keep sensitive files in local directories only
3. **Team Collaboration**: Share credentials through secure channels, never in code
4. **Regular Rotation**: Periodically update API keys and secrets

## Project History and Major Changes

### Recent Major Refactoring (August 2025)
1. **Repository Structure Reorganization**: 
   - Moved from 21+ root-level documentation files to organized `docs/` structure
